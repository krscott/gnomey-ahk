Adds (slightly janky) behaviors to the (Left) Windows Key:
- Win by itself will open Win+Tab view
  - But, typing will still start a search
- Win+LMouse will start dragging the window under the mouse
  - Snapping to edges still works

## Bugs

For some reason, this script works way better when AHK Window Spy is open (even if minimized).
So, I should look into why that is.
